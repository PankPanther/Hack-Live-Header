Introduction
HTTP Live Header Hack is a browser extension designed for developers, testers, and enthusiasts who need to inspect, monitor, and manipulate HTTP headers in real time. The extension provides a user-friendly interface for capturing HTTP requests and responses, allowing users to view, edit, and manipulate the headers for debugging or other purposes.
Whether you're debugging an API, inspecting cookies, or simply learning about HTTP headers, this tool will empower you with control over your browser's HTTP communication.

Key Features
•	Real-Time HTTP Header Inspection: Capture and view all HTTP request and response headers in real time while browsing.
•	Header Modification: Add, remove, or modify request/response headers on the fly.
•	Advanced Filtering: Filter requests by method (GET, POST, etc.), domain, or resource type (XHR, script, image, etc.).
•	Custom Rules: Set predefined rules to automatically modify or add headers for specific websites or requests.
•	Export and Import Rules: Easily export your custom rules or import them from another machine.
•	Network Throttling: Simulate different network conditions (e.g., 3G, 4G) to see how headers change under varying network speeds.
•	Security Insights: Identify potential issues with CORS, content security policies, and other security-related headers.
•	JSON and XML Request Parsing: Automatically parse and pretty-print JSON or XML data within the headers.
•	Cross-Browser Support: Works seamlessly on major browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Chromium-based Edge.

How It Works
1.	Installation
Download and install the extension from the respective browser's extension store (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, etc.).
2.	Capturing Headers
Once installed, the extension will automatically begin capturing HTTP requests and responses in the background as you browse.
3.	Modifying Headers
Users can modify any captured request/response headers directly within the extension’s UI. After modification, the altered headers will be sent with the request or response.
4.	Custom Rules
Set up custom rules to apply specific header modifications automatically for defined conditions, such as particular websites or request types.
5.	Network Simulation
Use the network throttling feature to simulate different network speeds and see how that affects HTTP headers.
